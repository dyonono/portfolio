							<p>This is my cat Rocky. He lived with me in an apartment last year, where I took lots of pictures with him. Now he lives with my parents, but he's coming back to Ann Arbor with me next year!</p>

					<p>Rocky is my beloved pet cat who is probably around eight or nine years old now and has been my companion for most of them. He's a red tabby and white Exotic shorthair and used to be a show cat; he almost became a grand champion in just one cat show (he earned 199 of the 200 points needed to become a grand champion in the first show) and was on his way to becoming a regional winner in the Great Lakes region of the Cat Fanciers Association, but my mom's health issues cut Rocky's cat show circuit short. He's super funny and extremely cute and I run an Instagram account for him called @mycatrocky. Here's a gallery of some fun pictures of Rocky â€” hover over the image to see it in color.</p>
