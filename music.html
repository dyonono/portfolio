				<h1>Music that I enjoy</h1>
					<p>My thoughts on many new albums from the last year or so can be found in my reviews on <cite>The Michigan Daily</cite>, but here are three albums I really love that I've never had the opportunity to talk about in writing.</p>
				<img src="images/binarystar.jpg" alt="Masters of the Universe album cover">
				<h2>Binary Star - <cite>Masters of the Universe</cite></h2>
					<p>This album is an underground hip hop masterpiece. It's got timeless beats and solid flows and for although it was released in 2000, it feels very old-school, very '90s, but still extremely fresh and exciting to listen to today. My favorite tracks are "Reality Check" and "Honest Expression."</p>
				<img src="images/daftpunk.jpg" alt="Discovery album cover">
				<h2>Daft Punk - <cite>Discovery</cite></h2>
					<p>I wasn't a huge electronic music fan when I first heard this album but it made me reconsider the potential for the genre. In much of electronic music's history the album format has not been as heavily championed as the single, but <cite>Discovery</cite> is an <em>experience</em>. It might be my favorite album of all time, and I couldn't pick a single favorite.</p>
				<img src="images/kerokerobonito.jpg" alt="Time 'N' Place album cover">
				<h2>Kero Kero Bonito - <cite>Time 'N' Place</cite></h2>
					<p>If <cite>Discovery</cite> is my favorite album of all time, then <cite>Time 'N' Place</cite> is probably my favorite album right <em>now</em>. It dominated my Spotify Wrapped of 2019. I just really love the playful, fun, but also emotional indie rock sound. My favorite track is "Time Today."</p>
